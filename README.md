he Correlation & Insight Explorer is an interactive web app built to help users explore how key climate indicators—like CO₂ emissions, temperature anomalies, and sea level rise—are connected. It was developed during my bachelor’s thesis at Riga Technical University to make it easier for people to understand the relationships between these variables across time and different regions. The goal is to support climate education by offering a hands-on, visual way to spot patterns and uncover insights.
